![DailyGo. Being ative can be fun. Ignite your inner monsters and illuminate your day with DailyGo.](https://github.com/Rena52107/assets/blob/main/dailygo/dailygo_socialmedia_assets.png 'DailyGo social media asset')

DailyGo is a mobile application that encourages users to be more active in their everyday lives while incorporating gamified challenges. By setting up daily step goals, users will be motivated to walk or run - solo or as a team - in order to cheer up in-app monsters by obtaining fireflies. As users achieve their goals, they earn rewards and can take on bigger challenges for even greater rewards, both individually and as a team. Being active can be fun with DailyGo!

## Features

- **Walking Tracker**

  - The walking tracker feature accurately tracks walking activities in real-time, allowing users to monitor their progress and set goals. Users can interact with this feature by tracking their sessions, viewing real-time data, accessing activity summaries, and retrieving data on their devices. This feature is relevant to users as it helps them track their achievements, identify areas for improvement, and stay motivated.

- **Gamification**

  - **Collecting Fireflies to Cheer Up Monsters**
    - This feature adds a gamified element to walking, enhancing user motivation and engagement. It solves the problem of monotony and the need for more motivation in traditional walking routines.
    - By walking and achieving daily goals, users can collect fireflies and bring light to their inner monsters in a positive way. Those monsters will represent the lack of activity - the more the user collects fireflies, the happier the monsters will be. Interacting with this feature involves collecting fireflies, setting goals, tracking progress, and receiving rewards. It is relevant to users as it adds excitement, a sense of achievement, and motivation to the walking experience.

- **Maintaining the Streak**

  - To engage the user to achieve goals in the long term, the app will give special rewards for long streaks with goal completion, and the user will be able to spare the days that they couldnâ€™t achieve the daily goal with hearts. The longer the streak, the more fireflies and hearts the user will collect.

- **Collaborate With Other Users**
  - This feature enhances social interaction during walking activities. It addresses the problem of a lack of social engagement during walking by providing group challenges and social media sharing. Users can interact with this feature by joining groups, participating in challenges and sharing achievements on social media platforms. It is relevant to users as it builds a community and provides motivation during walks. With more users, groups can outrun larger monsters. Thereby, increasing user engagement over time and helping to grow the user base.

#### Cloud and Scalability

The DailyGo app leverages MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based storage of user information, health data, and challenge details. This ensures seamless data management, retrieval, and security. MongoDB's advanced querying capabilities enhance user experiences. The combination of MongoDB and Node.js facilitates scalability by providing horizontal scalability for data and efficient handling of concurrent connections.

#### Stability and Industry Standards

AWS and Node.js are employed to ensure the app's stability. AWS offers a reliable cloud infrastructure, while Node.js, with its event-driven architecture, contributes to a stable and resilient application. Expo and Express frameworks follow industry standards, providing a robust and well-documented foundation for mobile app development and scalable APIs.
